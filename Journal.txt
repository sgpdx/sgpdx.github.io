1.  Took handwritten notes on the requirements of the project
2.  Created sgpdx.github.io GitHub Pages site & repo
3.  Decided to go with a single page HTML file
4.  Decided to start with a base with my favorite exercise so far, the Bootstrap exercises.
    Found the exercise that nicely arranged boxes based on various screen sizes, Boostrap Exercise 03-Grid
    Copied over that completed exercise's HTML file and its associated CSS file
    One issue that came up is there were two styles.css files, so I decided to combine them into one
    My plan is to first make edits here, to outline all the 5 required sections and experiment with styles
    before filling in any details about the sections.
