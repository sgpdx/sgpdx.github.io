- Saved a copy of my web dev project in a different repo, so I could overwrite this one

Sunday February 8, 2026
- Deleted unneeded files and added new files using HW 3 as a base for code to start with 
(using Pug, Express.js)
- Using GitHub Copilot, figured out how to convert this code into one that can run via github.io,
since we aren't using "node app.js" to run it anymore, like we did in HW3.
It suggested a build.js file, and then I need to run "npm run build" 
to create the html pages based on the pug templates
