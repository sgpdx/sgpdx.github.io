Early Feb, 2026
- Saved a copy of my web dev project in a different repo, so I could overwrite this one

Sunday February 8, 2026
- Deleted unneeded files and added new files using HW 3 as a base for code to start with 
(using Pug, Express.js)
- Using GitHub Copilot, figured out how to convert this code into one that can run via github.io,
since we aren't using "node app.js" to run it anymore, like we did in HW3.
It suggested a build.js file, and then I need to run "npm run build" 
to create the html pages based on the pug templates

Saturday February 14, 2026
- Set up all the pages with their pug templates and a basic outline for the page with
headings, placeholder flex or text boxes, etc.  Ran "npm run build" to set up the .html
- Testing the site constantly with nodemon
- Starting to play around with styles to make the Navbar Green to be on the 'plants' theme
- Next steps, I need to figure out how to bring in the API Data dynamically

Sunday Feburary 15, 2025
- Went back over the requirements for the project and realized that I don't actually have to use a database!
I remember the professor saying we needed to create an API and a Database during our Zoom Check-in call, 
but looking back over the instructions, that's option 1: 
"Build a front-end, back-end, and an API, implementing calls to create, update, and delete items from a database"
I specifically chose option 2 which is just using an API: 
"Build a front-end and a back-end, and use a third-party API on the back-end"
So, that's a relief.  I need to focus more on my back-end and calling the API next.
- A classmate for HW3 suggested caching the API data, which is a great idea, so I keep that in mind.
- Removed tracking of the "node_modules" folder from github and added to .gitignore
