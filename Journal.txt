Early Feb, 2026
- Saved a copy of my web dev project in a different repo, so I could overwrite this one

Sunday February 8, 2026
- Deleted unneeded files and added new files using HW 3 as a base for code to start with 
(using Pug, Express.js)
- Using GitHub Copilot, figured out how to convert this code into one that can run via github.io,
since we aren't using "node app.js" to run it anymore, like we did in HW3.
It suggested a build.js file, and then I need to run "npm run build" 
to create the html pages based on the pug templates

Saturday February 14, 2026
- Set up all the pages with their pug templates and a basic outline for the page with
headings, placeholder flex or text boxes, etc.  Ran "npm run build" to set up the .html
- Testing the site constantly with nodemon
- Starting to play around with styles to make the Navbar Green to be on the 'plants' theme
- Next steps, I need to figure out how to bring in the API Data dynamically
