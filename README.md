# sgpdx.github.io

## site deployed to: https://sgpdx.github.io/

- Site Deployed via documentation found at: https://docs.github.com/en/pages
- Some parts of the code were modified from homework assignments which I completed for this class, found at: https://github.com/sgpdx/webdev-lab-notebook
- Modal code snippets based on examples found in the Bootstrap documentation (further edits were made to customize it): https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/
- Some of the code snippets (such as CSS styling) & the idea for the video.js file (ie: embedding a YouTube Video) came from this site: https://dev.to/juliafmorgado/automatically-embed-latest-youtube-videos-on-your-website-with-javascript-step-by-step-2i5e
  - Note: The code was not usable as written in the sequence given, so in addition to fixing syntax errors at first, I then proceeded to rewrite the whole thing to display a single video instead of multiple 'dynamic' videos as the original code intended
- I don't remember the exact sites I used to build the contact form beyond what we learned in class (I added a working submit button that sends to my @pdx.edu email address with the values of the form in the body of the email) but the information was found through general Google searches.
- All Images & SVGs were obtained online except for my headshot which is copyright Serena Glick, 2023, taken at the Columbia Sportswear Company Photo Studio.
